        <p>
          We are introducing a new concept called Stable PROGRESSIVE Coin. As we
          seen with platform like safemoon and certain crypto exchanges that
          charges more than 10% fees when you buy or sell. Here we are creating
          a system that is fair, transparent, and will generate astronomical
          yields (profits) for its holder This new Concept will change the
          financial world as we know it. The idea of Stable Progressive
          Currencies is to create a currency that continuously increase in value
          and never decrease in value. MINDCHAIN is just that currency. To
          make that possible we use an Elastic Infinite Supply protocol and
          fees-based system. Here not like every other cryptocurrency available
          in the market that an initial supply, at MINDCHAIN the initial
          supply is Zero At Hotfriescoin No coins are minted (created) out thin
          air. Coins are minted ( created), when they are bought with a
          stablecoin (BUSD) and coin are burnt (destroyed) when they sold for
          exchange of stablecoin (BUSD). Each time a mint or sell transaction
          occurred a 10% is applied and distributed to all MINDCHAIN holders.
          MINDCHAIN can only be bought with stablecoin (BUSD) to guarantee
          price stability. This fundamental tokenomics conception allowed us to
          create the worldâ€™s first Stable Progressive Coin.
